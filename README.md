# tree-sitter-coconut

A [tree-sitter][] grammar for [Coconut][].

[tree-sitter]: https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter
[Coconut]: https://coconut-lang.org/

This is very much a work in progress.


## Coconut Features

<https://coconut.readthedocs.io/en/latest/DOCS.html>

Below are Coconut features and their implementation status in this grammar.

- Operators
  - [x] lambda syntax
  - [x] partial application
  - [x] pipes
    - [x] in-place pipes
    - [x] lambda as last argument of pipes
      - [ ] for backwards pipes
    - [x] piping into `(<name> := .)` to assign to a `<name>`
  - [ ] function composition
    - [x] basic implementation
    - [x] in-place operators
    - [ ] finish tests
    - [ ] highlight queries
  - [x] iterator slicing
    - [x] implementation
    - [x] tests
    - [x] highlights
- Keywords
  - [x] where statements
- Expressions
- Function Definition
  - [x] assignment functions
    - [x] basic implementation
    - [ ] finish tests
- Statements
- Built-Ins



- [ ] highlights
- [ ] tests for highlights


## Development

- <https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/creating-parsers>

`cargo install tree-sitter-cli`

### helix

You can see how the grammar works for syntax highlighting by trying it out in the [helix editor](https://helix-editor.com/).

Add the following to your [language.toml file](https://docs.helix-editor.com/languages.html):

```toml
[[language]]
name = "coconut"
scope = "source.coconut"
injection-regex = "coconut"
file-types = ["coco"]
shebangs = ["coconut"]
roots = ["pyproject.toml", "setup.py", "poetry.lock", "pyrightconfig.json"]
comment-token = "#"
# language-servers = [ "pylsp" ]
# TODO: pyls needs utf-8 offsets
indent = { tab-width = 4, unit = "    " }

[[grammar]]
name = "coconut"
source = { git = "https://github.com/rtbs-dev/tree-sitter-coconut", rev="master" }
```

Now you need to fetch and build the C headers for the parser. 

```bash
$ hx --grammar fetch
$ hx --grammar build
```

Helix uses syntax highlighting and indentation queries from it's own runtime directory, not from the tree-sitter package (because Helix uses some of its own names in the queries). So, for now we can do something like this:

```bash
$ ln -s $HELIX_RUNTIME/runtime/grammars/sources/coconut/queries $HELIX_RUNTIME/queries/coconut
```

Helix should now recognize the queries for syntax highlighting, which you can confirm with `$ hx --health coconut`

> Later, the `queries/helix` folder should probably become a pull request into helix's source.

Now try opening a coconut file in helix, and you should have syntax highlighting!
